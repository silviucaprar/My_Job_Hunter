Hi, 

I'm Silviu and I like to work in automation testing.

Here is my first project done with Playwright, Cucumber and Typescript.

This is My Bot Hunter v1.0 which is searching for "qa automation engineer" role on LinkedIn.

For now I'm using the "Easy Apply" filter and it's working only for the applications that have the "Submit Application" button.

More features to come.

Stay tuned.

Thank you very much.
